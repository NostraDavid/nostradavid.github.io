		<h1>World of Warcraft Starter Edition Guide</h1>
		<p>aka trial/f2p/free to play edition</p>
		<p>Note: This guide is written so people who are new to World of Warcraft/MMOs can be eased into Retail for both newbies to World of Warcraft in general and for MMO newbies.</p>
		<p>So you want to try out World of Warcraft, but haven't played Warcraft since The Frozen Throne came out in 2003? Then you're on the right track to become the best Level 20 <abbr title="Toon refers to a created character played by you, the player">toon</abbr> there ever was!</p>

		<h2>World of Warcraft Lingo/Jargon/Terminology</h2>
		<p>Every game has a few terms that have a specific meaning, but WoW has quite a few. Here are one that I've encountered in my adventures.</p>
		<table>
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<th>Jargon</th>
					<th>Meaning</th>
				</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>adds</td>
					<td>Monsters <strong>added</strong> during a bossfight</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>DOT</td>
					<td>Damage Over Time - certain attacks do damage over time, instead of a single damage</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>AQ</td>
					<td>The Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj, a raid located in . AQ20 is the 20 man raid, AQ40 the 40 man raid.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>proc</td>
					<td>Short for 'spec_proc', short for 'special_procedure'. </td>
				</tr>

		<h2>Zones & Spawn points</h2>
		<p>The world of Warcraft is cut up into zones. The enemies of each zone are set to a specific level. Hover on your in-game world map to see which zone is made for each level. Starter zones (where your toon spawns) are always set to 1-10</p>
		<p>Below you can see the zones, its levels and each race's spawn point</p>

		<h2>Limitations</h2>
		<p>It would not be a trail version if it did not have some restrictions. Here are the ones I've walked into during my playthroughs:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Level limit of 20</li>
			<li>Gold limit of 10</li>
			<li>No pet battles</li>
			<li>No adding strangers as friends</li>
			<li>No auction house</li>
			<strong>MAKE SURE THE ABOVE IS TRUE</strong>
		</ul>
		<p>Note: This is NOT an extensive list. Just the things <em>I</em> have run into</p>

		<h3>Level limit</h3>
		<p>This means your movement is restricted to certain zones. Any zone whose minimal level goes several levals above yours means you will miss some 95% of your hits and thus won't be able to do any damage before running out of materials too boost you enough to kill even a single enemy</p>
		<p>You also won't be able to gain <em>all</em> abilities, as you gain those per several levels. No worries though, by the time you are level 20, you will have enough abilities to have fun with.</p>

		<h3>Gold limit</h3>
		<p>Minor spoiler: You <em>will</em> be able to buy a mount, but only the basic ones. Anything beyond that will mean you can't buy it, simply because you can't hold enough gold.</p>
		<p>You can somewhat work around this limit by buying <strong>ethereal threads</strong> <strong>MAKE SURE THIS IS TRUE</strong>, which can stack up to 200, which means you can use it as a gold replacement. Kind of annoying since you lose a lot of money, but it's better than nothing.</p>

		<h3>Pet battles</h3>
		<p>You may notice small critters running around (bunnies and the like). You can kill them (which I sometimes do out of frustration, because no pet battles ;_;), but when you click on them, you'll get a notification that you can not do any pet battles.</p>

		<h3>No friends</h3>
		<p>can't add friends IIRC.</p>

		<h3>Auction house</h3>
		<p>Simply not available, which means you can't sell or buy things there <img src="sadge" alt="Sadge"></p>

		<h2>How to choose the best race and class</h2>
		<p><strong>I recommend starting with the class</strong> and then choosing an available race, because certain combinations aren't possible (like an Undead Paladin - yes, <a href="dead-link">lorewise there are two</a>, but I'm talking <em>gameplay</em> here.)</p>

		<h2>Classes</h2>
		<p>There are several pretty typical ones, like Warrrior and Priest, but also some uncommon (and unchoosable ones) like Death Knight and Demon Hunter</p>

		<h2>Races</h2>
		<p>You can choose the basic ones (see below), but not certain sub-races. If you don't see them mentioned, then they are not choosable</p>
		<h3>Choosable</h3>

		<dl>
			<dt><strong>Alliance</strong></dt>
			<dd>Human</dd>
			<dd>Dwarf</dd>
			<dd>Night Elf</dd>
			<dd>Gnome</dd>
			<dd>Draenei</dd>

			<dd>Tauren</dd>
			<dd>Troll</dd>
			<dd>Blood Elf</dd>
			<dd>Goblin</dd>
			<dd>Pandaren</dd>
		</dl>

		<h2>Minimap</h2>
		<p>You can enable a whole bunch of icons to show up, but not all of them are useful.</p>
		<table>
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<th>Symbol</th>
					<th>Meaning</th>
				</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td><span class="unicode color-gray">❔</span></td>
					<td>A quest, but its inside a building, cave or grotto</td>
				</tr>

				</tr>

		</table>

		<h2>Classes</h2>
		<p>There are several pertty typical ones, like Warrrior and Priest, but also some uncommon (and unchoosable ones) like Death Knight and Demon Hunter</p>
		<h3>Choosable</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href=classes/druid>Druid</a></li>
			<li><a href=classes/mage>Mage</a></li>
			<li><a href=classes/paladin>Paladin</a></li>
			<li><a href=classes/priest>Priest</a></li>

			<li><strong>UNFINISHED</strong></li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Settings</h2>
		<p>World of Warcraft has quite a few non-standard options for games in general getting used to them is a bit of a bitch, so here's a guide on what does what</p>
		<strong>Check out and make screenshots of menus</strong>
		<p>You can point and click, like an RTS (NOT RECOMMENDED - use the autorun option instead)</p>
		<p>Enable all the menubars, so you can fill the shit out of them. You will not use what you can not see.</p>
		<p>Enable auto-looting - you can always throw away the things you don't use (or don't cost anything)</p>

		<h2>Shortcuts</h2>
		<p>World of Warcraft has a ton of menus and submenus and finding those is a total bitch to do.</p>
		<p>Remembering shortcuts is (IMO) much easier. Remembering <kbd>shift-p</kbd> to get to the Pets window is much easier than looking at the microscopic icons in the lower right of the screen and hovering over them one after the other because you can't recognize the icons very well yet and og god where is the icon for pets again? This one? No, This one? No, Maybe this one??? <em>Fuu<sup>uuu</sup>uuck!</em></p>
		<p>Note: I only take into account the <strong>default</strong> shortcuts.</p>
		<table>
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<th>Shortcut</th>
					<th>Action</th>
					<th>Note</th>
				</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td><kbd>tab</kbd></td>
					<td>Select enemy</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><kbd>cltr-tab</kbd></td>
					<td>Select friendly</td>
					<td>Great when you need to heal who's closest to you</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><kbd>shift-p</kbd></td>
					<td>Pets/Mounts window</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>

		<h3>Customize the default layout</h3>
		<p>I don't fully agree with the default World of Warcraft layout</p>
		<p>The autorun button's default is kinda weird, IMO</p>

		<h1>TODO</h1>
		<p>Create separate pages for the classes (which specializations exist and what you can do with them) and races (where each race can buy bigger bags, buy the ethereal thread, etc)</p>
		<p>Also create separate pages for professions, which are popular, what they're used for ect</p>
		<p>As last: Create beginner zone tips - where most people hang out, where you can find important shops, etc</p>
		<p>expand on shortcuts</p>
